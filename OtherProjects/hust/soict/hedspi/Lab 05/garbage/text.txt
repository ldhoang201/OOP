Television is one of the many wonders of modern science and technology. It was invented in England by the Scottish scientist J.N. Baird
in 1928 and the British Broadcasting Corporation was the first to broadcast television images in 1929. Previously the radio helped us hear things from far and near. spread information and knowledge from one corner of the globe to another. But all this was done through
sound only. But television combined visual images with sound. Today we can watch games, shows, and song and dance programs from all corners of the world while sitting at our own homes. TV can be used for educating the masses, for bringing to us the latest pieces of
information audio-visually and can provide us all kinds of entertainment even in color. But as in all things, too much televiewing may prove harmful. In many cases, the habit of watching TV has an adverse effect on the study habits of the young. When we read books, we
have to use our intelligence and imagination. But in most cases, TV watching is a passive thing. It may dull our imagination and intelligence.
Modern civilization is based upon the use of machines. For doing their workday in and day out the machines need a constant supply of energy without which they would come to a halt. Our transport systems-diesel-run railways, steamships, motor vehicles, aeroplanes-all
constantly need natural fuel to keep on moving. In the last three hundred years, much of human efforts have been spent in search of the sources of energy-coal, petroleum, and power generated from water–which will maintain the present rhythm of civilization unchecked.
Not only that; as the population of the world increases, the need for energy will also increase. But there is the real fear that the world reserves for energy sources of petroleum, coal, and hydel-power are gradually being exhausted. That is why new and unconventional
sources of energy like nuclear and solar energy need to be developed. While the advanced countries in America and Europe have the wealth and scientific know-how to produce solar and nuclear energy on a commercial scale, the poorer Asiatic countries like India,
Pakistan, and Bangladesh may develop an energy source by bio-gas-developing machines. But the point is that researches in the field of development of new energy sources must be carried on further and expedited so that the exhaustion of the conventional sources of
power does not adversely affect the growth of our economy and progress of civilization.
